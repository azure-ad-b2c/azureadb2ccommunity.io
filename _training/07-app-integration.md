Your application, regardless if it is a web, mobile, desktop or single page application, initiates an authentication request referencing a policy id, such that a specific policy can be executed. The policy controls what the experience will be for this scenario.  The policy generates a token at the end of its execution, and it will be sent to your application to be consumed. This flow applies to any Azure AD B2C policy. 

The steps inside a policy can vary from policy to policy. It is truly based on set of steps you specify.
